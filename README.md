What is a README File?
The Readme file is often the first file that the users read. It is a text file that contains information for the user about the software, project, code, or game, or it might contain instructions, help, or details about the patches or updates.

When you create a repository or a project, GitHub gives you the option of a default readme. The default readme file contains the repository name and some basic instructions. The file format is ‘md’, which stands for Markdown documentation. It is a lightweight markup language that can be easily converted to text.
